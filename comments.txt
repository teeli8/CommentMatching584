I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.Obviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.I literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult.
